  <h3>How do you become good at betting</h3>
  <p>A common mistake that most people make when they start betting is to grab the most expensive skin in their inventory and all in. While this is a great way to win, this is extremely risky. 
  What happens if you lose? A better less risky alternative which most good betters do is to split their inventory into percentages or parts. For example imagine if I have 1 AK Frontside Misty ($5), a M4a4 Dragon King ($2), Awp Worm God ($1) 2 keys ($2.50 each) and five 50c skins. 
  As you can see, the total is $13.50. Now say theres a match on CSGOLOUNGE- Fnatic vs Navi for example. You want to bet on Navi but there is too much risk. So what is the best option? To go LOW which should be around 2-5% of your invenotry. 5% of your invenotry is around 60c. So you put in a 50c skin. If you win you might double or triple that amount. However if you lose, you only lose 50C.
  If you are patient are a good better, you will slowly make that $13.50 up. There will be losses which is inevitable and you might lose say 20% in a week. But you win back 30%. So you have a profit of 10%.</p>
