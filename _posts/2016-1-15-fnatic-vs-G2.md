G2: It seems G2 is in terrible form this year and being unable to beat teams that are of the same level or higher. G2 recently had a game too close for comfort against Chinese team CyberZen and got stomped by LG.
In their previous contests, the most recent being on the 3rd of December last year Fnatic won (16-1) and (16-6) in 2 maps. 

Fnatic: Fnatic are a solid team and with dennis instead of pronax, their gameplay is going to new heights. It seems Fnatic have not lost their touch after not playing for a few weeks, shown by the wins over ?(TSM) and ex-Titan, though they did lost to EnVyUs (but EnVyUs op).
It seems the odds are pretty bad for fnatic and I would like to go big on them but G2 can win if they get insanely hot but that is very unlikely.

Bet: SKIPPPPP or if you are rich - GO MEDIUM ON FNATIC
Risk: LOW
