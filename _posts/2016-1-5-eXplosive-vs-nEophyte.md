Hey guys today my prediction will be extremely short as there isnt much info on nEophyte.
According to GosuGamers, nEophyte is ranked 34th in the world while eXplosive is ranked 153rd in the world. Quite an impressive gap. However that does not mean eXplosive can win.
After digging around, it seems nEophyte has lost a match quite recently to a team ranked around 170ish.

eXplosive: def is out again with LK replacng him yet again. eXplosive is a great team, just lacking the ability to close up rounds. 
nEophyte has losing quite a bit in its past matches and to be honest I dont actually know how good they are (sorry).
On HLTV, the odds are in favour of eXplosive and my best advice is go for a low bet on eXplosive or skip.

Update: Someone has told me that the old nEophyte team was ranked 34th and the new one is pretty bad which i can believe.
