E.frag.net is one of my favourite teams as they are reliable and consistentish against crappy teams and unlike other teams, don't throw games. I've won quite a bit from betting on E-frag
and I believe this match is going to be the same.
BX3 and E-frag have played once before in a BO3 where E-frag narrowly won but that was 3 months ago and E-frag has gotten better even though dream3r has a VAC.
BX3 just isn't a good team and this game, they are gonna get it up the ass by a team which has better players, better aim and better everything.
My bet: Medium on E-frag 
Risk: Low as hell
