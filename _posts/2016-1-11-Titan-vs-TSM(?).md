This match screams UNDERDOG everytime I look at it. So far this year, TSM have played PENTA and Vexed and have smashed them both 2-0.
TSM is one of the best CSGO teams in the world, ranked at 4 by HLTV and even without a sponsor, they are still the same old TSM that can dominate other teams in CSGO.
TSM also is proficent in every map and like all pro teams have excellent teamwork and skill.
Titan hasn't played an offical game this year but thye have the potential to beat TSM even though their lineups history says otherwise.
If Titan gets to play DUST 2, they might have a chance to beat TSM- as it is one of their most played maps and ScreaM is GOD. Titan is a very underrated team in my opinion and can still beat them BIG TEAMS.

Bet: Low on Titan (UNDERDOG BET with a lot of potenital profit)
Risk: HIGH as hell
