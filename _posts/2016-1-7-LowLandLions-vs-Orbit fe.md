This match is going be fun to watch. A crappy team vs a crappy team. 
Orbit fe are the female equivalent of Orbit except they are lacking in one thing. Skill. They have played two games so far and have lost 2-16 and 1-16. To be fair they were against nEophyte and London Conspiracy which are wayyyy better than some trash like LowLandLions.
LowLandLions on the other hand are also lacking in one thing. Skill. However they have had some close games against Ephihany Bolt and they have actually won a game out of their past 5 matches.
Last time i checked, the odds were like 15-85 (LowLandLions- Orbit fe). They are probably gonna change. 
My bet: Low on LOWLANDLIONS.
Reason: Both teams are bad but I think LowLandLions have more experience and a little more skill than Orbit fe and if the odds are that juicy for LowLandLions, then wy not?
