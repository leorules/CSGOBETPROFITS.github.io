Hey guys today's match is a game between no-name Korean teams and I'm not even sure if its on CSGOLOUNGE or Fanobet but it would be a fun game to predict.
WHY Schwyz does not have a good looking match history. It has only played one game against another Korean team (autocracy.kr) and lost 16-0. 
That is enough sway me to bet low oln Lafaint. WHY Schwyz top player has a K/D of 0.19 so yeah.... 
If you have guts to bet and if it is added on CSGOLOUNGE, take some time to bet some trashy skins you dont like.
