First of all I'm gonna say that Fnatic should have lost to LG yesterday if LG didn't make them mistakes. After seeing fnatic play in the StarSeries, I don't think they are playing their best and I wouldn't be surprised if they lose to NAVI.
fnatic in their first game against EnVyUs were smashed to pieces. Their game against TSM was pretty normal winning 2-1. If you look closely at the maps that fnatic has played, you will see that they lost at mirage every single bloody time- (8-16 against EnVyUs)(8-16 against TSM)(6-16 against LG).
fnatic even lost mirage last year in the BO5 against NAVI(6-16). If mirage doesn't get banned, I can see NAVI winning mirage. 

Navi has made me lose some money when I betted against them in the EnVyUs game. I will never make that mistake again. 
Everytime they are underdogs, they seem to win. I don't think NAVI is gonna play train because it will be probably vetoed by Fnatic. Like fnatic, NAVI has only lost 1 match in the Series (LG) and they utterly suprised me when they shut down EnVyUs.

Both teams have great players and the most notable (the carries) are probably in my opinion (Olof and Guardian). Overall, this match says RISK all over it and U should bet on the team that U believe is gonna win. 
People are saying Fnatic are probably going to win but NAVI has a real serious chance of beating them. After all not many people expected them to beat EnVyUs yesterday ( notably me) so maybe a LOW bet is the best choice.
Warning: It will be a dangerous risk to beat big on this game, it can go either way.

MY bet: LOW on NAVI
Risk: High as hell
