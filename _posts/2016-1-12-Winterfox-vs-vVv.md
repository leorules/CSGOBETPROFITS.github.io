Winterfox: A team that in 2015 in November and December stepped up its game and started winning games without PYTH who is now NIP. 
In my opinion Winterfox is a team that doesn't have potenital to beat better teams but is consistent against teams in similar tier or worse teams. 

vVv: I've seen this team play last year and to be truthful, I wasn't impressed.
I have nothing to say much about this team except they lost to Method while Winterfox beat them 2-0. 

Bet: Medium on Winterfox
Risk: Low
