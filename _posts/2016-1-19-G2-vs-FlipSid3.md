Considering the odds which are 71-29 on CSGOLOUNGE last time I checked, this is a perfect opportunity to go underdog FlipSid3. G2 aren't impressing anyone, not with the recent gameplay they have produced. A narrow win over CyberZen and 2-0 losses against LG, fnatic and NAVI.
Dunno what is happening with them but there are rumours of strategic issues with G2. Putting a big bet on G2 at the moment is not really a wise thing to do.
In terms of experience FlipSid3 has more as a team with the exception of Shara who has around 26 games with the team. G2's present team has under 100 games together ( I'm not counting aizy) and there are obviously difficulties right now as G2 has been underperforming and not doing very well.

FlipSid3 had a surprising win over E-frag yesterday. I say surprising because a team of E-frag's caliber would at least take 1 map off FlipSid3 in a BO2. Obviously I was wrong and I have to say that the strong performance of FlipSid3 yesterday has convinced me that FlipSid3 actually have a chance.
If you check HLTV, you may see that FlipSid3 has won twice against Kinguin last year, once in a BO2 and a BO3. Do not bet on FlipSid3 just cause of these results. Those results came from last year and Kinguin has changed into G2 and aizy has come into the team. So anything can happen this match.
Don't forget that this match is a BO2 so if you bet on CSGOLOUNGE, a tie will give back your skins. 

Bet: Low FlipSid3 ( This is a BO2 so less risk)
Risk: HIGH ( Even though it is a BO2, G2 is/was a good team)
