Keyd Stars: A good team with consistent victories and has ever growing potenital. They have not lost a single game in the MAX 5 Invitaional, winning 3 and tied once.
In comparison with g3x, Keyd Stars has more experience as they played n 2015 and winning quite a number of games including ones like Luminosity (who easily smashed g3x 16-2) and higher tier teams.
Their teamwork, aim and overall skill is way higher than g3x. Keyd Stars also has a bigger map pool and that will be a important factor in this BO3 match.

g3x: A new team that only has lost 1 game in the MAX5 Invitaional. But one thing is obvious. g3x is not even cloes to Keyd Stars in skill level.

Bet: HIGH on KEYD STARS. RISK: LOW
