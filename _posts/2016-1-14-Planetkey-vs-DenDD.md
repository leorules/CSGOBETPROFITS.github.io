A extremely short prediction today. 
DenDD: Despite its numerous losses in its match history, if you look closely, you can see that most of thoes matches were extremely close.
Take DenDD vs TSM. DenDD lost the first map 9-16, won the second 16-11 and narrowly lost the decider 16-19. Another example is against mousesports (19-21) and 10-16.
Looking at this, I see that DenDD has a lot of potenital and looking at the odds, this is a a great low bet.
Both teams haven't played an official game since last year so we haven't got any indication if they improved or got worse.
Planetkey has more experience and have played longer as a team (HLTV Stats) but they do lose or tie against teams like PENTA and KILLERFISH. Not saying they are bad but if DenDD can come close against higher tier teams such as SK, mouse and TSM, that is quite self explanatory.
I am just taking a teeny little risk so if you dont like that sort of stuff, maybe skip the game.

Bet: DenDD (LOW)
Risk: HIGH
