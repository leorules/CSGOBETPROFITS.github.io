Quick analysis here. 
SK has been doing well so far this year, beating FlipSid3, Enso and Vexed. And I'm sure they will do better than last year due to signing of Pimp.
mousesports haven't played an offical game this year but the signing of NIKO last year strengthed their team. 
Since it is a BO2, I reckon this match is gonna to be quite safe to bet on. 
With pimp on SK, i believe SK has wayyy more potenital and they can beat mousesports easy if NIKO doesn't turn into god NIKO. If SK picks Train which is one of their most played maps, I believe the worst case scenario will be a 1-1.
Bet: Low on SK
Risk: HIGH- but B02.
