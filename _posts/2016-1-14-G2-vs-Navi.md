G2 isn't really impressing me at the moment. Thank god I never bet on this team. Yesterday they nearly lost against Chinese team Cyberzen.
The score was 16-6 Inferno (CyberZen's map choice and win), 14-16 (G2's map choice and narrow win) and 11-16 (Mirage and G2's win).
Then they got smashed by Luminosity which was expected but G2 hardly got any rounds against them and lost 7-16 on their map choice which was Inferno (man what are they thinking, they lose 16-6 to Cyberzen on Inferno and they pick Inferno against Luminosity).

Navi has being doing slightly better. They smashed CyberZen 16-5, 16-7 on Mirage and Train. However they did lose to LG but it was much closer than G2.
Navi narrowly lost 14-16 on Train (Luminosity's map choice) and lost again 9-16 Mirage. Looking back at these results, I feel that NAVi has being doing way better than G2.
In terms of experience, NAVI has way more as a team while G2 is a jumble of random people of different languages. (I'm slightly biased to Navi). 
If you are on HLTV and you saw the lineup history which NAVi lost 4 out of 5 times to G2, don't wory about it because that was when they had dennis.

Bet: I'm betting Medium on Navi, but if you're povo and have not many skins ( DW I USED TO BE LIKE THAT TOO ), go low on NAVI.
Risk: Medium-Highish.
