Another incredbily short prediction. Expendables is not a remarkably good team and Far East Boys have only played one game. However the teams that the Expendables lost to are the best of the Asian teams. 
Personally I am going extremely low bet on Expendables on the hope that Far East Boys are worse than them but since it is an extremely risky bet, the best option is to skip.
Since I am betting for profit I can take the risk of going low for a big gain.
