Epiphany:
Though Epiphany is a very inconsistent team, they can pull off some amazing plays as seen in yesterdays game against Mixcat. 
If they repeat their level of gameplay, they can easily pull of  a win against RCTIC.

RCITC:
RCTIC hasnt been doing that well lately with their in game strats not working and the inability to close rounds. Though they have beat Epiphany recently on cache, it was 
a close game. 

Epiphany has a stronger map pool and that will give them the advantage in this match. RCTIC and Epiphany rely strongly on their carries and they have similar skill level. 
However I believe Epiphany will win 2-1.
