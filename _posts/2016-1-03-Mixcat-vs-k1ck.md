Both teams have been doing extremely well in the past few weeks. 
K1ck has beat Onlinebots, RCTIC and Publcir.se but losing to Mixcat on dust 2 (16-6). 
However K1ck has a way bigger map pool and this may be the advantage in a BO3.
Mixcat has also en extremely well, winning all 5 of their past five games easily winning against their opponents with just better aim and cooperation overall.

The odds were 81-19 for Mixcat vs k1ck last time i checked and if you rather not take the chance, it would be a wise game to skip.
However a low bet on k1ck is also a wise decision as they do have the skills to beat MIXCAT. So my advice to is to go low on underdog :smile:
