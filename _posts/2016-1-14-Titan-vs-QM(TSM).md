Another extremely speedy analysis. I am conviced that a ICB Titan is worth it because of the extremely close game 3 days ago.
Titan lost a extremely close first map 19-21(Overpass), won a extremely close second map 21-17(train) and lost dust 2 (7-16).
Looking at this, I guess it is kinda worth it to chuck in those 3 -10 cents skins you dont like.
Bet: Titan (ICB)
Risk: HIGH
