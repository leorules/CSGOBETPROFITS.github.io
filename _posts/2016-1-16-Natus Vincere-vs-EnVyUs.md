A extremely short prediction today. Ignore EnVyUs's lineup history against NAVI as that was ages ago and also because EnVyUs are on bloody fire and are playing on a whole new level. 
Any mistakes that NAVI will make will be punished pretty bad by EnVyUs and NAVI has been making mistakes that lose them game such as the one against Luminosity (NAVI SHOULDA WON TRAIN).
I can't see NAVI win against the form and teamwork that EnVyUs has shown in the StarSeries final. 
Bet: Low-Medium on EnVyUs
Risk: HIGH
