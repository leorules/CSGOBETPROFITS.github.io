For this game, it is best to skip. However if you dont mind being risky-

eXplosive has been winning games and against their last five opponents, they have beaten 4.
However it is confirmed that LK will play instead of def and caution is advised as we do not know how good of a player he is.
In all their previous BO3 against YP, eXplosive has lost all of them which is a saddening fact and one we need to take into consideration.

YP is the opposite of eXplosive, winning only once against 5 five opponents. However all their team is playing and their gameplay is not one at which you would laugh at.
YP is the overdog, beating eXplosive in all their previous mathes. In terms of maps, YP's most played and strongest is DUST 2. 

Both teams have most experience in Cache, Dust 2 and Mirage and their map pools are of similar size. If you want to go 'safe', go on a bet on YP.
If you want to go risky as eXplosive has a sliver of chance to beat them. If odds fall under 70 for YP, it is advisable to go on them. However my bet will be a low on eXplosive.
