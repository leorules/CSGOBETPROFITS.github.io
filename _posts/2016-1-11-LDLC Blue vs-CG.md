Another quick anaylsis today. To be truthful, I dont know much about CG or LDLC Blue. However I know that LDLC isn't that bad of a team, having some narrow losses against better teams.
I'm not sure if CG is a new team but when I check on HLTV, they only had played 3 games- A BO3 against HELLRAISERS and surprisingly, CG won 2-1.
I'm taking a bit of a risk here but if CG can beat HellRaises, then i'm pretty sure they can beat LDLC Blue. 
Bet: Low on CG
Risk: Medium
