ALTERNATE aTTax's new team has entered the CSGO scene this year aftre signing new players after their team disbanded in the previous year.
So far they have played HellRaisers (lost 2-1) and a extremely close game against Aligon (lost 2-1), Quest (won 2-0) and G2 (lost 2-0).
I don't have much to say about this team except they aren't bad but they aren't too good either.

CG: A team that qualifed for the PGL's European Minor Championship after beating HellRaisers 2-1 and quite recently beat LDLC Blue 2-1 too.
This team obviously has skill to beat two teams that have more experience than them.

Bet: Low on CG

Risk: Medium
