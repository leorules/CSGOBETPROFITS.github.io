LowLandLions: 
Their new team has little to no experience and are well, not very good even though they beat Orbit fe yesterday (16-1) and Auctur (16-12).
However those teams are crappy noname teams that have little to no experience and **skill**. 
Imperial Dragons on the other hand have actually decent gameplay, smashing teams like eXplosive (16-1) and nEophyte (16-9) who actaully have skill and wins overall.
This game is a no brainer and I suggest a HIGH bet on Imperial Dragons even though the odds are probably crap.
