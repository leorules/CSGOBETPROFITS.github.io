Luminosity: They are the best Brazilian team in the world and are in the top 10 CSGO TEAMS (HLTV) and they have swatted and crushed the other Brazilian teams in the MAX5 Invitational.
AlienTech: They have been one of the better of all the trashy Brazilian teams and have won 3 out of 4 games in the invitaional, even beating Games Academy on one of their best maps- Cobblestone.
In terms of experience and skill, Luminosity ticks all the boxes and I just can't see AlienTech winning.
My bet: SKIP or go medium on Luminosity because they are probably going to win.
