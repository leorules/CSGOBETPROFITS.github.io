Hey guys, my first CS:GO prediction will be on Epiphany Bolt vs Mixcat. Lately both teams have been doing well in their CSGO matchups. However Epiphany Bolt has justed signed a new player and their gameplay may take time to reach its full potenital. On the other hand Sunny and the boys from MIXCAt boys have gone full-time CS as they have dropped their jobs, and are serious now. They had times when they were amazing, it's just the fact that they didn't have the effort/motivation. So if you want to bet on this match, go medium as MIXCAT have got it easy.
