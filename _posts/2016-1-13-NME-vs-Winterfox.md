Everywhere I look, it seems everyone is favouring Enemy to win. It seems I must agree with them. Since NME has swapped Lucky with Anomaly, I feel like they have improved.
Looking back at Enemy's most recent games last year, they narrowly lost to Conquest, but they beat SPLYCE and Cloud9 with the latter being one of the best NA teams.
koosta (the best player on NME) is also a god and op awper and he will probably be carrying NME. Also, looking back at previous matches with Winterfox, NME has won them all but that was quite a long time ago and Winterfox has improved hugely.

Winterfox is a good team and with desi and the rest of the boys, they can win. They do pretty well against crapper teams and teams around the similar skill level. 
However I feel like they don't do as well against better teams and this along with the improvement of NME is gonna lead me to bet on NME.

Bet: NME
Risk: Medium
