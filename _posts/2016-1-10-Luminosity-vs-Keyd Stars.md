Luminosity has been on a stampede recently, smashing all the crappy Brazilian teams and demolishing AlienTech in its recent win (16-1), (16-8).
Luminosity is a consistent team that is one of the top 10 CSGO TEAMS and they have great teamwork and skill. LG is also pretty decent in all maps.
Keyd Stars has also beaten most of their opponents in this MAX5 Invitational and stumbled to a 2-1 win over g3x. This game is going to be a interesting one.
However I can't see Keyd Stars beat Luminosity no matter how huge nak goes. 
Bet: Medium on Luminosity.
