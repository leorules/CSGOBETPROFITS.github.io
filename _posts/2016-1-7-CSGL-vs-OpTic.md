OpTic is the former team Conquest and still retains their former players except they swapped ryx for stainslaw. They are a very good team but this is going to be a tough game against CSGL. 
CSGL are red hot at the moment, beating mousesports, Dignitas and Vexed and it isn't just flukes. 
Both teams will be playing like hell for the top prize- $35000 cash money and I expect a battle between the carries- NAF FLY and MICHU.
Overall this is gonna be 1 hell of a game (I hope) and since the odds are pretty even, I would recommened a _low OpTic_. 
But this game also screams SKIP SKIP SKIP so if you are a poor and dont want to lose skins, SKIP the match.
