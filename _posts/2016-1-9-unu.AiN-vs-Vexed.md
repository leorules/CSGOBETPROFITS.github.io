This game is going to be hard to predict but here i go.

unu.AiN: unu.AiN is one shifty ass team. They have HUNDEN (swoon, swoon) but i have to say he isn't that great ( no offence to all HUNDEN fans). 
Their match history last year shows some nice wins against teams like PENTa, Orbit but they havent played as a team professionaly for like 2 months and in terms of experience, is dwarfed by Vexed.

Vexed: A decent team with its fair share of losses and wins and like i said before, has a lot of experience as a team and have been pretty warmed up playing in matches this year.
I've watched their matches and I _believe_ in their skill and teamwork.

Bet: LOW on Vexed ( I don't want to go higher because I haven't seen unu.AiN play)
