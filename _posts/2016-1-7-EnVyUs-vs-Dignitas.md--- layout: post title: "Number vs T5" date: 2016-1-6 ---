Another short prediction today.
Everyone is obviously thinking that EnVyUs will win and Dignitas stand no chance and woah they lost to CSGL, they must be crap.
But since it is just after a break, anything can happen and EnVyUs isnt invicible. A map I can see which Dignitas will not get slaughtered at is Train and hopefully Dignitas will turn on hacks and win.
Since I am betting for profit, I'm going low on the small chance Dignitas will win but if you aren't a person who goes for risks, a medium EnVyUs is good.
