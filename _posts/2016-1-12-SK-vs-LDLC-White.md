LDLC White: LDLC White despite first appearance of a not as popular team, is actually not bad and last year had actually pulled off scores such as 16-2 against Titan.
However they were smashed by unu.AiN 2 days ago.

SK: A team that is superior in LDLC White in players (Pimp and Magiskb0y are really good players), experience and better gameplay.
This game is a BO2 and I just can't see LDLC White taking 2 maps off SK so I guess this game is quite safe to bet on.

Bet: Medium on SK

Risk: Low
