I dont think this match is on CSGOLOUNGE so go to fanobet where you can bet on this match. 
Number has won 2 out of 2 games with impressive wins - (16-0) and (16-3). 
T5 on the other hand has only won 1 out of the past 5 matches and by itself that doesnt look appealing. But if you look closer, you will see that T5 played against teams like inchk1ng and J2G which are some of the better asian teams.
Like the bet on Expendables vs Far East Boys where i made huge profit (http://csgobetprofits.github.io/predictions/2016/01/05/Expandables-vs-Far-East-Boys/), I would suggest to go low on T5 as the teams that Number beat are plain crap.
However if you are a poor guy who wants SAFE bets, SKIP THIS MATCH.
