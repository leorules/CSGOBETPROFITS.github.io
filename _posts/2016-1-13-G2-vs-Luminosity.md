This is one juicy game to bet on- HIGH RISK but tht equals HIGHER REWARD. 
G2: Last time I saw G2 playing LAN was at IEM San Jose last year and despite G2's results there, its hard to know how much they improved or what to expect from the team since it was 2 months ago. 
However it is confirmed on Maikelele's twitter that he forgot his passport and could not travel to Minsk yesterday and hopefully he can catch the next flight and still make it on time : https://mobile.twitter.com/G2Maikelele/status/686873152912232448.
Looking back at G2's most recent games, their match against Arcade last year (16/12) ended up in a narrow win for G2 and their game against Alternate was slightly concerning on the fact they barely won on cobblestone (16-14) as Alternate is not even close to G2 in terms of skill.

Luminosity: A team that has amazed me time and time again. When I look back last year November, I remember that they lost 16-0 to fnatic and the next day, beat NIP and EnVyUs in BO3 thrillers. Then on the day after that, they beat TSM and lost in a slightly close game to Fnatic.
Then the next month they did crap in the ESL ESEA PRO LEAGUE. However an edge I can see Luminosity have over G2 is that this year, LG have played in the MAX5 Invitational and that time have made them ready to play any team. And the fact they smashed every team in that Invitational.
Everyone in LG plays a big part in their games. They have a great awper, a great entry fragger, a great support and well you get the idea.

In terms of map choices, both teams are pretty even in terms of good and bad maps. 
Well if you are poor and don't have much skins to go with and you don't like the risk, maybe this game isn;t for you.
But if you want to bet, I suggest a LOW - MEDIUM on LG. I feel like with the extra game time they have and their superb gameplay and teamwork, they can beat G2.
Risk: HIGH
