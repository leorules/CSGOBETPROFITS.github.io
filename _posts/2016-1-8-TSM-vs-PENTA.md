Penta has been doing well so far this year but the outcome of this game is near certain. TSM (?) will completely wreck PENTA.
This is because of the level of difference in skill, aim, more experience and the fact that they are better at everything. I think TSM will be determined to win to show everything their skill blah blah blah and get a team.
Bet: Since the odds are extremely bad it is wise to skip or if you have them cash money, go for a big bet on TSM.
