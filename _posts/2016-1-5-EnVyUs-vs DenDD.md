I saw this match on reddit and apparently its today even though HLTV doesn't have the match up yet.
Chances are the odds will be 95-5 on CSGOLOUNGe and those are unfavourable odds.
I have without a doubt that EnVyUS will win but you have to bet a lot to win so less.
ADVICE: SKIP or if you are extremely rich and don't mind the 0.1% chance that DenDD will win, go on a big hefty bet on EnVyUS.
