Quick analysis here boys and girls. E-frag is a great team, very consistent against lower tier teams and is in the top 20 teams CSGO (as rated by HLTV).
The team has been together a number of games with the exception of pNshr who is new to the team but they are still making great plays and having good team co-operation.
I personally haven't see DeadPixels play but judging from their match history, they should be beaten easily be E-frag. 
Bet: MEDIUM E-FRAG
RISK: LOW
