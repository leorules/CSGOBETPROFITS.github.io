Winterfox: They have improved lately and even though they nearly lost against a UNKNOWN NA team, they have the potential to beat SPLYCE.
Their gameplay is actually decent and with DESI, anything can happen. 

SPLYCE: SPLYCE which used to be 3SUP is now not as good as before and their new team without PTR and Stewie are only just winning against crappy unknown teams.

MY ODDS: 65-35 (Winterfox - SPLYCE)
Both teams are exceptionally close in all maps but i reckon Winterfox will prevail.
