People are saying theres no chance at Luminosity beating fnatic. That is absolute bull. Luminosity is probably having the time of their lives here and there is no doubt, they really want to win against fnatic.
Alright lets look at the facts and not my own damn opinion. 
Lineups, head to head:
28/11 15 Luminosity vs.  fnatic - FACEIT League 2015 Stage .. - train 16-9
28/11 15 Luminosity vs.  fnatic - FACEIT League 2015 Stage .. - cobblestone 11-16
28/11 15 Luminosity vs.  fnatic - FACEIT League 2015 Stage .. - inferno 7-16
26/11 15 Luminosity vs.  fnatic - FACEIT League 2015 Stage .. - dust2 0-16
29/10 15 Luminosity vs.  fnatic - DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoc.. - inferno 16-13

If you ignore the 16-0 in dust 2 which LG might ban, you can see that Luminosity won once then lost once and then got recked in the BO3. However I do not spot the map that Luminosity may have the upper hand against fnatic. That one map which Luminosity might have the advantage is cache. In cache, fnatic relies on Olofmeister to carry them as I have seen in many pro cache games with fnatic.
Everytime theres a cache game, Olof usually gets a pretty high percentage of the team's kills and you can check this out for yourself in HLTV. Cache is Luminosity third most played map and despite only 7 times from November, they had three losses of which two was extremely close (19-21 against NIP), (14-16 against Method).
fnatic has won 4 out of 5 games recently and the loss was against a team that actually had balls (EnVyUs) but I wouldn't count G2 as a great win because they suck now anyway.
LG are just steamrolling them BO3 (2-0) and won against G2 (again nothing to boast about) and with NAVI (What the hell actually happened in the game).

If you believe LG has potential to win, you are absolutely right. A team of LG's caliber can beat fnatic though I have to admit, if LG won then fnatic probably screwed up a lot.
Man all those people on reddit are like HEY LG has no chance and <70 GO BIG ON FNATIC. But fnatic aren't invicible and if you believe people like those, your invenotry is going to dissapear real quick.
There is too much risk in the game and the safest option is to GO LOW ON LG and hope for a win and easy profit.
